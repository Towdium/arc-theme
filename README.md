# Arc Grey Theme

Well, this is my personal port of [Arc Theme][1], changing the color to purely grey, similar to project [Arc Grey Theme][2]. For a detailed introduction, you can go to the readme file of the two projects.

This is created for my personal use, I create it since there is some rendering issue with Arc Grey Theme on my GNOME desktop while the original Arc Theme dose not.

All the source is fetched from Arc Theme repository, then all the color code is tweaked to grey by the python script `togrey.py`.

I can't promise it works with no issue, but I'm using it with no problem. You are welcomed to discuss with me, but if the problem also happens with Arc Theme, I'm afraid I can do nothing with it.

Have fun!
